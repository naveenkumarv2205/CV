  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <p><ol><li><Strong>Motion Capture</Strong></li></ol></p>
 <ul>Motion capture has traditionally been limited to professional animators due to the expensive and complex equipment required for capturing data. However, the emergence of markerless and sensorless motion capture, aided by computer vision and low-cost devices, has enabled new possibilities. This project presents a technique that utilizes multiple photoresistors analyzed by individual processes and communicates through Arduino, offering more flexibility and accuracy in capturing human movement. This could expand the applicability of motion capture and reduce errors caused by inter-observer variability.</ul>
